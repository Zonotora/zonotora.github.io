31. A noisy system. Noise audits observed significant differences of the variability of decisions. The median difference when deciding the value of a stock was 55 percent, which was 5 times as much as the managment expected.

32. We will expect that organisations and their systems will give us reliable and consistent results. We do not expect some kind of noise within the system. In reality customers are likely to participate in a lottery without their knowledge. Even the ones responsible for the system are often without knowledge.

32. Distinctive for noise within a system is that it is undesirable. However, varability is not always undesirable. Think about preferences and differences of taste.

33. Noise is a problem in systems like organisations, not in markets. In fact, it is the principle of disagreement that makes markets possible.

34. A common misinterpretation of undesirable variability is that it does not matter, because the randomness will make sure that errors cancel each other out. This interpretation is correct when dealing with positive and negative errors in a judgement of the same circumstances. However, to show when this interpretation is wrong consider this example. If two criminals that both should be sentenced to 5 years in prison in fact get 3 years and 7 years respectively, no justice has been served. The mean value which is 5 years cannot consistute as justice. In noise systems the erros do not cancel each other out. They accumulates.

34. None had expected the levels of noise that was discovered.

35. People accepted it, not because it was resonable, but because none had discovered it.

35. People that had heard about noise audits did not really believe that they were a part of it.

35. Other people look at the world in nearly the same was as I do. This is an example of *naive realism*. We almost never questions these beliefs. We keep *one* interpretation of the world at a time, and seldom devotes much time at consider other alternatives. One interpretation is enough and we believe it as the truth. We do not walk through life and reflect about alternative ways of seeing what we are seeing.

37. The rutines in place are often made in a way to minimize the disagreement and ignore the disagreement if it after all arises.

37. The fact that it is so easy to agree about a bad judgement, may amplify the illusion of agreement. The real point — the constant presence of the noise — is therefore often overlooked.

37. Everywhere where decisions are made, noise is present. And a surprising amount of it.
