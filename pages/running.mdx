# Training

## Different zones


## The Norwegian Method

The philosophy of the Norwegian Method is mainly applied to endurance sports like running, cycling and swimming with a focus on increasing the anaerobic threshold. The foundation of the Norwegian Method is to measure the lactate levels to control the intensity during runs. It is split into 3 different training zones based on the intensity levels as different energy systems are trained optimally in different zones:

- `Zone 1: Low intensity`. Zone 1 focuses mainly on the `oxidative energy system` which is responsible for low-intensity work.
- `Zone 2: Sub threshold`. Zone 2 focuses on the `anaerobic energy system` which is required for high-intensity work. The anaerobic energy system gets activated when a lot of energy is released within a small period of time, and when the oxygen demand is greater than the oxygen supply. Utilizing the anaerobic energy system will more quickly drain your energy.
- `Zone 3: Above threshold`. Zone 3 also focuses on the `anaerobic energy system`.

The key idea of the Norwegian method is to perform the most important workouts in zone 2. As stated above, zone 2 lies at or below the `anaerobic threshold`.
By staying close to the threshold, we can stimulate the anaerobic energy system without becoming to fatigued.

This means that a workout in zone 2 should not stay in the anaerobic zone for too long as that accumulates fatigue. [^1]
