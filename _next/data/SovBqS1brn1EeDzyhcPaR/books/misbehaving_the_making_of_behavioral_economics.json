It is a cost that is paid in the past, and should no longer be relevant when making decision about the future.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias\">hindsight bias</a> is a tendency for people to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they actually were.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory\">prospect theory</a> observes that agents asymmetrically feel losses greater than equivalent gains. It stems from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">loss aversion</a> that states that agents tend to avoid losses. TODO</li>\n<li>Diminishing marginal utility of income and wealth is the principle that a rich person will have reduced utility of a change of wealth relative to a person with less wealth. If we graph this curve which is logarithmic we get the curve on the positive y-axis in the prospect theory.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law\">Weber-Fechners law</a> states that \"the minimum increase of stimulus which will produce a perceptible increase of sensation is proportional to the pre-existent stimiulus\". Most psychologists refer to this law as Just Noticeable Difference (JND).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What Tversky and Kahneman argue for in [1] is that humans have limited time and intellectual resources. The consequences of that is that they do everything by simple rules — heuristics — when they are making judgements. Thaler highlights the example \"availability\". When people are asked whether \"Dhruv\" is a common name, people from most countries will with quite high probability say no. However, it turns out that this name is very common in India and India is a country with a lot of people. So in a global scale, Dhruv seems to be a quite common name.</p>\n<p>Thaler has a list of examples that highlights what the standard model based on rational choices cannot really explain. Each one of the examples is based on systematic bias. Kahneman and Tversky's ideas laid the ground for future work that could make something serios of the examples.</p>\n<p>Ovidkommande faktorer</p>\n<p>Mental bokföring\nIcke återvinningsbara kostnader</p>\n<p>Självkontroll\nviljestyrka\nplaneraren och verkställaren</p>\n<p>anomalier\nsnäv inramning\npriset är inte rätt</p>\n<p>spara mer imorgon\nknuffar (nudge)</p>\n<p>Victor Fuchs, Eric Wanner, Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein</p>\n<h1>Links</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Risk aversion. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion</a></li>\n<li>St. Petersburg paradox. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox</a></li>\n<li>Expected utility hypothesis. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<p>[1] Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974). <em>\"Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\"</em>.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
